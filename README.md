This Python function generates a list of numbers within a specified range with a defined step. It provides an easy way to create custom numerical sequences within a given range.

"result = generate_range(start, end, step)"

start: The starting value of the range.
end: The end value of the range.
step: The difference between each consecutive number in the range.

Example
start = 0
end = 20
step = 2
result = generate_range(start, end, step)
print(result)
This example will generate a list of numbers starting from 0 up to 20 with a step size of 2. The output will be:
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]

Requirements
Python 3.x
